	<p>1. Purpose of html5 semantic tags - to help the reader easily navigate the page and to give the page order when editing or finding a problem.
	Most useful tag - I think the basic HTML layout elements are the most useful. They give the basic layout for the page and all additional tags flow from there.
	2. Order browser uses to display elements - Top to bottom
	3. What did you learn about sublime & will you create more snippets? - Well I learned about snippets in sublime and I think I will create more to save time on reusable code.
	4. Difficult concept? Improve on? - The most difficult is remembering what tags can go where. I think I can improve most on learning more about the different semantic tags</p>
