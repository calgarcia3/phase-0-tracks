# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is keeping different versions of the same document seperate and organized. Version control is useful when trying to find a bug or working on previous version of your current document.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? 
A branch is a version of your document seperate from the master original copy.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a change to your document. It is good to keep track of what changes you are making and when.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when two documents are too different and can no longer merge together. For example, you fork a document and try to merge at a later date, but due to the changes they are no longer compatable.
